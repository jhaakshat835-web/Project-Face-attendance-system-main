## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RajeebLochan/Project-Face-attandence-system.git
cd Project-Face-attandence-system
```
2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# For Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
⚠️ Note for Windows Users: You must have Visual C++ Build Tools installed to compile some dependencies.
💡 Linux Users: No additional C++ setup is required.

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

If you use the included virtual environment, run the server from the inner project folder where `manage.py` lives.

PowerShell (activate then run):
```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\aj394\Downloads\Project-Face-attandence-system-main\Project-Face-attandence-system-main"
.\..\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python manage.py runserver
```

Or run without activating the venv (direct call):
```powershell
& "C:\Users\aj394\Downloads\Project-Face-attandence-system-main\venv\Scripts\python.exe" "C:\Users\aj394\Downloads\Project-Face-attandence-system-main\Project-Face-attandence-system-main\manage.py" runserver
```
